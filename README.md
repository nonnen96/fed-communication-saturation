# fed-communication-saturation

**Quantifying the impact of Federal Reserve communication intensity on market volatility using NLP and machine learning**

## Description

This project investigates how the intensity of Federal Reserve communications affects financial market volatility. Specifically, we explore whether excessive communication leads to a **saturation effect**, where markets become less sensitive to new messages, reducing their impact—a phenomenon we refer to as **resonance**.

Using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and machine learning techniques, we aim to:

- Collect and preprocess Federal Reserve communications (speeches, press releases, meeting minutes).
- Extract linguistic and sentiment features using NLP techniques.
- Quantify the market’s reaction and potential saturation effects.  
- Model the relationship between communication intensity and volatility metrics like the VIX.

## Project Status

This project is **currently in progress**. Data collection, feature engineering, and model development are ongoing. Future updates will include quantitative results and visualizations.
